                    Hello! I'm Gavin Hensley. I’m a developer that is on a constant mision to expand my knowledge in languages and frameworks, such as C#, Unity, C++ After some time in the audio industry, I found myself drawn more and more to the software I used. I wanted to know how they worked and interacted with the various media I was interested in. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a bachelor’s degree in New Media and Communication Technology from The Ohio State University. There I learned the importance of understanding how people interact with technology and the social implications of said technology. I was taught UI and UX principles as well as the history and the theories surrounding communication technology. There was some coding involved, but there is always more to learn, so I decided to enroll in the We Can Code It boot camp in Cleveland, Ohio. As I gather knowledge and create new projects, I will put them on display on this page. Thanks for stopping by!
